### Notes
- Cluster: master, node(s). Nodes run "kubelet": the k8s agent, which communicates with the master via the "k8s API". Other software can use this API to interact with the cluster. Nodes also run the container daemon/runtime used to run software on them, e.g. Docker.
- Minikube: CLI for managing local clusters for dev etc. Backed by xhyve / VirtualBox / etc for the VM to run the node(s) on.
- kubectl: CLI for managing kubernetes clusters.
- "Deployment" instructions to k8s master for deploying and manaing your app. Kubernetes Deployment Controller watches machines ("nodes"), and re-schedules containers from unhealthy machines to healthy ones.
